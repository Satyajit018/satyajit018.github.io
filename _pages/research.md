## Multiscale, multi-physics, and multifidelity modeling of intelligent materials system
3D/4D printing offers us the opportunity to print multifunctional materials. To fully leverage this potential, it is imperative to advance microstructure characterization across various scales, coupled with Multiphysics modeling to encompass the intricate processing involved. Moreover, the integration of experiments and simulations, characterized by differing fidelity levels, necessitates a robust strategy. The analysis of multifidelity data, in conjunction with calibration techniques for capturing uncertainties and sensor-generated noise, stands as a critical endeavor. Novel methodologies are paramount to surmount these challenges, ultimately enabling more proficient design and manufacturing of intelligent material systems. These advancements find application in diverse fields, including soft robotics and beyond.
