Greetings and welcome to my webpage. I am Satyajit Mojumder, an incoming assistant professor in [School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at Washington State University, Pullman, WA](https://mme.wsu.edu), starting in Fall 2024. I completed my PhD in the Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Program at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), Evanston, USA, in June 2024. I hold bachelor's and master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Before joining Northwestern, I served as a lecturer and was later promoted to the position of assistant professor in the BUET Mechanical Engineering Department. 

My research focuses on understanding the nexus of mechanics, materials, and manufacturing through the development of advanced computational methods. Specifically, I am interested in solving large-scale, multiphysics problems that are prevalent in advanced manufacturing and materials systems leveraging mechanistic reduced-order models and AI-based algortihms. 

I am originally from a small town, Magura, located in southern part of Bangladesh. I grew up surrounded by nature and a beautiful river named Nabaganga just a few steps from my home. I have a passion for teaching and mentoring, and in my free time, I enjoy visiting tranquil places.

To learn more about me and my research, please explore the other pages on my website.
