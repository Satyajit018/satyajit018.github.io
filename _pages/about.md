Greetings, I'm Satyajit Mojumder, a researcher specializing in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, currently affiliated with Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. My academic journey includes a Ph.D. earned at Northwestern University, where I delved into the intricacies of "Digital Thread for Polymer Additive Manufacturing Materials" under the guidance of Prof. Wing Kam Liu. My educational background also comprises an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, both from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. My research interests encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from Multiscale Materials Modeling and Polymer Additive Manufacturing to Data-driven Mechanics, Nonlinear Heterogeneous and Composite Materials, and Nanomechanics. Over the years, I've gained invaluable experience as a Graduate Research Assistant at Northwestern and as a Research Engineer at HIDENN-AI LLC, Oak Brook, IL. In addition, I've contributed to the academic community as a Lecturer at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, BUET, Dhaka, Bangladesh. My research endeavors have been supported by grants, including the Navy SBIR Phase I and NSF ACCESS, and I've been honored with fellowships like the Walter P. Murphy Fellowship and the Predictive Science and Engineering Design Fellowship. I'm deeply committed to advancing the field of Mechanics and look forward to engaging in collaborative research and discussions within this dynamic domain.
